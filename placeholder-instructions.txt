PLACEHOLDER INSTRUCTIONS

Please place your logo.png file in the root directory of the project.
This file should match the purple hexagonal logo shown in your message.

If you don't have the exact image file, you can save the image from your message as "logo.png" 
and place it in the same directory as the index.html file.

The optimal dimensions for the logo should be approximately 40px in height, with proportional width.
